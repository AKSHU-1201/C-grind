//Pointers

int i = 7;
int* j = &i; int* is data type for a pointer and int* j is a integer pointer which stores the address of i(or pointing towards i)...

printf("The address of i is %p ",&i(or j)) # pointer/address requires %p as their data specifier(%u also works)


#Value at address --> *(address) it will give you the value at that address
for ex:
print("%d", *j) --> j stores the address of i = 72 and *j access the value at the address stored in j so *j = 72 and j = 00FAA16(address of i in this form)

Now, #Other Types of Pointers

char c = 'A';
char* j = &c; #Here j is a character pointer

similarly you can have float pointer , and NOTE: if data type is int then int* , if float then float* and similar for any other data type...

// Call by Value and Call by reference 

Call by Value --> We pass the actual arguments to the function 
Call by Reference --> We pass in the addresses of the actual arguments....
